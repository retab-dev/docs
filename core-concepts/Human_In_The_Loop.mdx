```

An **extraction** can request a human review when a boolean condition you define evaluates to the desired trigger state (typically false). This lets you route edge cases to a reviewer directly in the dashboard — without Automations.

## Introduction

Retab can flag extractions that need a second look based on conditions you control. Add any boolean in your schema (or computed during inference) and connect it to the human-in-the-loop criteria. When the condition triggers:

- **requires_human_review**: true in the projects/extract response (field on the completion object)
- **human_review_flag**: "pending" in the stored extraction and in the dashboard

## Define a condition in your schema

You can designate any boolean field as a human-in-the-loop trigger. For example, define a field like `is_document_an_invoice` and instruct the model to act as a judge for this condition during inference. If the condition evaluates to the trigger state (e.g., false), the extraction is flagged for review.

### Example condition

- **Field**: `is_document_an_invoice: boolean`
- **Trigger**: When `is_document_an_invoice` is false
- **Outcome**: The extraction requires human review and appears in the dashboard with a pending status

## API response (projects/extract)

When you call `POST /v1/projects/extract/{project_id}` (or `client.projects.extract` in the SDK), the response is a `RetabParsedChatCompletion`. Use `requires_human_review` to know if a human review is needed.

```json (6)
{
  "id": "cmpl_...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "auto-small",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "parsed": { /* your fields, including is_document_an_invoice */ }
      }
    }
  ],
  "requires_human_review": true
}
```

The dashboard tracks review state via `human_review_flag` on the stored extraction.

## Review in the dashboard

- **Where**: Project → Monitor -> Files -> Pending review
- **Filter**: Use the "Pending review" filter (internally `human_review_flag = "pending"`).
- **Actions**:
  - Inspect the parsed output and the document
  - Make corrections to the extracted object as needed
  - Mark the extraction as reviewed

Once reviewed, the extraction moves to `human_review_flag = "reviewed"` and is removed from the pending queue.

That's it — use boolean conditions to route edge cases to reviewers and keep your pipeline robust without maintaining Automation/webhook setups in this flow.

## Webhooks

Retab uses HTTPS to send webhook events to your app as a JSON payload representing a `WebhookRequest` object.
You will need a server with a webhook endpoint that will receive the `webhook_request` payload, allowing you to process them as you want after that.


<ResponseField name="webhook_request" type="WebhookRequest Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="completion" type="ParsedChatCompletion">
      The parsed chat completion object, containing the extracted data.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="user" type="EmailStr">
      The user email address.
    </ResponseField>


    <ResponseField name="file_payload" type="MIMEData">
      The file payload object, containing the file name, url and other metadata.
      <Expandable title="properties">
        <ResponseField name="filename" type="str">
          The filename of the file.
        </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="url" type="str">
          The URL of the file in base64 format.
        </ResponseField>
      </Expandable>
    </ResponseField>


    <ResponseField name="metadata" type="dict[str, Any]">
      Some additional metadata.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>


To start receiving webhook events in your app:

- Create a webhook endpoint handler to receive event data POST requests.
- Test your webhook endpoint handler by marking a file as reviewed in the dashboard.
- Secure your webhook endpoint.


### Create your server with a webhook

Then, set up a route that will handle incoming webhook POST requests. You will need it to create an automation. Below are examples of webhook endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python (FastAPI)
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from main_server.globals.sdk.automations .webhooks import WebhookRequest
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(request: WebhookRequest):
    invoice_object = json.loads(request.completion.choices[0].message.content or "{}") # The parsed object is the same Invoice object as the one you defined in the Pydantic model
    print("📬 Webhook received:", invoice_object)
    return {"status": "success", "data": invoice_object}

# To run the FastAPI app locally, use the command:
# uvicorn your_module_name:app --reload
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

```javascript Node.js (Express)
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// Use express.raw() to get the raw body for signature verification
app.use(express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));

app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;
    
    // Decode and parse the webhook request
    const webhookRequest = JSON.parse(payload.toString('utf-8'));
    
    const invoiceObject = JSON.parse(
        webhookRequest.completion.choices[0].message.content || '{}'
    ); // The parsed object matches your Invoice schema
    console.log('📬 Webhook received:', invoiceObject);
    
    return res.status(200).json({ status: 'success', data: invoiceObject });
});

// To run the Express app locally:
// node your_module_name.js
app.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log('Webhook server listening on port 8000');
});
```

```bash testing locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"completion":{"id":"id","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"content":"{\"name\" : \"Team Meeting!\", \"date\" : \"2023-12-31\" }","role":"assistant"}}],"created":0,"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","object":"chat.completion","likelihoods":{}},"file_payload":{"filename":"example.pdf","url":"data:application/pdf;base64,the_content_of_the_pdf_file"}}'
```
</CodeGroup>


### Secure your webhook endpoint

When you set up a webhook, you provide an **HTTP endpoint** on your server for Retab to send data to. If this endpoint is not secured (i.e., it accepts unauthenticated `POST` requests from anywhere), it essentially becomes a public door into your system. **Any actor** could attempt to call this URL and send fake data. This is inherently dangerous: a malicious party might send **forged webhook requests** that masquerade as Retab, but contain bogus or harmful data.

To secure webhook deliveries, Retab employs a **signature verification** mechanism using an HMAC-like scheme. Retab and your application share a **webhook secret** (a random string known only to Retab and you). This secret is available in your [Retab dashboard](https://www.retab.com/dashboard/settings) (Labeled as `WEBHOOKS_SECRET`). Retab uses this secret to include a special signature header with every webhook request. When your endpoint receives the webhook, your code should perform the same HMAC-SHA256 computation on the request body using the shared secret, then compare your computed signature to the value in the `Retab-Signature` header. If the signatures **match**, the request truly came from Retab and the payload was not altered in transit.

<Warning>Make sure to set your `WEBHOOKS_SECRET` environment variable with the secret from your [Retab dashboard](https://www.retab.com/dashboard/settings).</Warning>

Here's how to implement signature verification in your webhook:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python (FastAPI)
import os
import json
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response, HTTPException
from retab import Retab
from main_server.globals.sdk.automations .webhooks import WebhookRequest

client = Retab()
app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook_handler(request: Request):
    payload = await request.body()

    # Signature verification
    try:
        signature_header = request.headers.get("Retab-Signature")
        if not signature_header:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Missing Retab-Signature header")
        # Verify the signature using Retab SDK
        client.verify_event(
            event_body=payload,
            event_signature=signature_header,
            secret=os.getenv("WEBHOOKS_SECRET"),  # Get secret from environment variable
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return Response(status_code=400, content=f"Signature verification error. Please verify your signature secret. {str(e)}")

    json_data = json.loads(payload.decode('utf-8'))
    webhook_request = WebhookRequest.model_validate(json_data)
    
    invoice_object = json.loads(webhook_request.completion.choices[0].message.content or "{}")
    print("📬 Webhook received:", invoice_object)
    return {"status": "success", "data": invoice_object}
```

```javascript Node.js (Express)
import express from 'express';
import Retab from 'retab';

const client = new Retab();
const app = express();

app.use(express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }));

app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    const payload = req.body;

    // Signature verification
    try {
        const signatureHeader = req.headers['retab-signature'];
        if (!signatureHeader) {
            return res.status(400).json({ detail: 'Missing Retab-Signature header' });
        }
        // Verify the signature using Retab SDK
        await client.verifyEvent({
            event_body: payload,
            event_signature: signatureHeader,
            secret: process.env.WEBHOOKS_SECRET,  // Get secret from environment variable
        });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).send(`Signature verification error. Please verify your signature secret. ${error.message}`);
    }

    const webhookRequest = JSON.parse(payload.toString('utf-8'));
    
    const invoiceObject = JSON.parse(webhookRequest.completion.choices[0].message.content || '{}');
    console.log('📬 Webhook received:', invoiceObject);
    return res.status(200).json({ status: 'success', data: invoiceObject });
});
```

### Exposing local server to the internet using ngrok

<Warning>To continue, you need to deploy your FastAPI app to a server to make your webhook endpoint publicly accessible. We recommend using [Replit](https://replit.com/) to get started quickly if you don't have a server yet. An alternative is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet.</Warning>


We have a very simple Dockerfile that fastapi+ngrok to get you started.
Check out the [webhook_server](https://github.com/retab-dev/retab/tree/main/examples/automations/webhook_server) folder for more details.

<Tip>You will need a ngrok auth token to run the docker container. You can get one [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)</Tip>

Start fastapi+ngrok server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash startup
git clone https://github.com/retab-dev/retab.git
cd retab/examples/webhook_server
docker build -t webhook_server .
docker run --rm -it -e NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=[your_ngrok_auth_token] webhook_server
```

```logs {4} server logs
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
🌍 Ngrok tunnel established!
📬 Webhook URL: https://some-random-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook
📬 Simple curl for testing: curl -X POST https://some-random-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/webhook -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"completion":{"id":"id","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"content":"{\"message\" : \"Hello, World!\"}","role":"assistant"}}],"created":0,"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","object":"chat.completion","likelihoods":{}},"file_payload":{"filename":"example.pdf","url":"data:application/pdf;base64,the_content_of_the_pdf_file"}}'
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it! You can start processing documents at scale.
