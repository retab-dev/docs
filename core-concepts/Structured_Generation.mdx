## What is Structured Generation

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Generation is a feature that ensures the AI model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.


## How to Use Structured Generation

Every LLM service providers native structured generation support. 


<CodeGroup>
```python python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

completion = reclient.completions.parse(
    json_schema=ResearchPaperExtraction.model_json_schema(),
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "..."}
    ],
    model="gpt-4.1",
    temperature=0
)
```
```json json_schema.json
{
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "title": "Title",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "authors": {
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "title": "Authors",
      "type": "array"
    },
    "abstract": {
      "title": "Abstract",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "keywords": {
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "title": "Keywords",
      "type": "array"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "title",
    "authors",
    "abstract",
    "keywords"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchPaperExtraction",
  "type": "object"
}
```
```json output.json
{
  "title": "The Impact of Climate Change on Global Agriculture",
  "authors": [
    "John Doe",
    "Jane Smith"
  ],
  "abstract": "This paper explores the effects of climate change on global agriculture, examining how rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are impacting crop yields and food security.",
  "keywords": [
    "climate change",
    "global agriculture",
    "food security"
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Usage involves defining a schema for your desired output and including it in your API request. The schema can be a JSON Schema document or a data model class (like Pydantic BaseModel) that SDKs convert to JSON Schema. The LLM generates responses conforming to that schema, eliminating the need for post-processing or complex prompt engineering.

## What Retab Brings

Retab is here to help you make the most out of structured generation, by providing a **batteries-included** plaform:

* **Preprocessing:** Automatically converts files (documents, spreadsheets, images) into LLM-readable formats, eliminating manual data conversion.
* **Schema UI:** Interactive interface to define output schemas visually without coding, accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
* **Project:** Spreadsheet-style dashboard to test model outputs across many examples, with performance tracking and metrics over time.
