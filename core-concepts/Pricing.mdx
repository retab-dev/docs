Retab uses a credit-based pricing system. Different models have different credit costs based on their capabilities.

## Credit Price

`1 Credit = $0.01`

## Model Credits

| Model Variant | Credits |
|--------------|---------|
| retab-micro | 0.2 |
| retab-small | 1.0 |
| retab-large | 3.0 |

## Pricing Formulas

### Extract, Split, Parse, Schema Generation

```
total_credits = model_credits × page_count
```

For **Extract** with consensus:

```
total_credits = model_credits × page_count × n_consensus
```

### Edit

The Edit API charges 3× the base rate because it performs multiple LLM operations (OCR, form field inference, and form filling):

```
total_credits = 3 × model_credits × page_count
```
