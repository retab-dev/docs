## Overview
This tutorial guides you through the process of extracting structured data from the Airbnb pitch deck using Retab, OpenAI, and Pydantic. We will define a schema to capture important entities from the document and use an LLM to analyze and extract relevant information.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- Python 3.8+
- `pydantic`, `dotenv`, `retab`, `openai`
- An `.env.production` file containing your API keys
- A [airbnb_pitch_deck.pdf](https://github.com/retab-dev/retab/blob/main/notebooks/airbnb/airbnb_pitch_deck.pdf) file in the same directory as the `main.py` file 

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic python-dotenv retab openai
```

Download the pitch deck:
```bash
wget https://github.com/retab-dev/retab/blob/main/notebooks/airbnb/airbnb_pitch_deck.pdf
```

## Step 1: Load Environment Variables
First, load the environment variables to access the API keys securely.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
assert load_dotenv(".env.production")
```

## Step 2: Define the Schema

### System Prompt

We will start by defining a system prompt that will guide the LLM to extract the data in the correct format.

```python
system_prompt = """
Your task is to extract structured information from pitch decks based on the provided schema. Carefully analyze the content to identify relevant details and populate each field accurately while maintaining consistency across extracted data.

Key Guidelines:
	1.	Understanding the Schema:
	•	The schema includes key entities such as the company, its investors, competitors, clients, team members, and business model. Each field must be carefully reviewed and filled with precise data extracted from the deck.
	•	Relationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.
	2.	Contextual Analysis:
	•	Consider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.
	•	Extract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).
	3.	Consistency and Accuracy:
	•	Ensure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.
	•	Avoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.
	4.	Data Formatting:
	•	Company Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.
	•	Website: Extract and format URLs correctly 
	•	Country: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.
	•	Business Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.
	5.	Handling Team Data:
	•	Identify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.
	•	Prioritize executives and founding members when available.
	6.	Dealing with Missing Information:
	•	If some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.
	•	Ensure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.

Extraction Output:
	•	The extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.
	•	The output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.

By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.
"""
```

Then we define a schema using Pydantic to represent the information to be extracted from the pitch deck.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict
from typing import List
from enum import Enum, IntEnum

class CompanyEnum(str, Enum):
    school = 'school'
    investor = 'investor'
    startup = 'startup'
    corporate = 'corporate'

    founderBackground = 'founderBackground'
    investor = 'investor'

    client = 'client'
    partnership = 'partnership'

class Company(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(...,
        description="Name of the identified company",
    )
    type: CompanyEnum = Field(...,

    lastName: str = Field(...,
        description="Last name of the team member",
    )
    title: str = Field(...,
        description="Title, position of the team member",
    )
    pastExperiences: str = Field(...,
        description="Previous experiences",
    )

class Deck(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        json_schema_extra = {
            "X-SystemPrompt": system_prompt
        }
    )
    name: str = Field(...,
        description="Name of the company",
    )
    website: str = Field(...,
        description="URL of the company website",
    )
    country: str = Field(...,
        description="2 letter Country code of the company ",
    )
    investors: Company = Field(...,
        description="Existing investors in the startup",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Think about the investors. Detail your thought process, and explain logically, step by step, who are the investors, detailing the cues and evidence for each one. For example: 1) Found X in cap table showing Y% ownership 2) Identified Z from 'backed by' slide with logo and investment date 3) etc."
        }
    )
    competitors: Company = Field(...,
        description="Competitors identified by the startup in the deck",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Walk through your analysis of the competitive landscape step by step: 1) Which companies are positioned as direct competitors? 2) What specific features/offerings overlap? 3) What market segments do they compete in? 4) What evidence supports each competitor identification?"
        }
    )
    clients: Company = Field(...,
        description="Clients (B2B) in pipe or signed by the startup in the deck",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Break down your client analysis systematically: 1) Which companies are mentioned as current clients vs pipeline? 2) What evidence shows their client status (testimonials, case studies, logos)? 3) What stage is each client relationship? 4) Are there any specific metrics or success stories mentioned?"
        }
    )
    team: List[TeamMember] = Field(...,
        description="Company Team",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Analyze the team composition methodically: 1) Who are the key founders/executives? 2) What specific evidence validates their roles? 3) How did you verify their background and experience? 4) What makes their experience relevant to this venture?"
        }
    )
    businessModel: BusinessModel = Field(...,
        description="Business model of the startup",
        json_schema_extra={
            "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Explain your business model classification process: 1) Who are the primary customers? 2) What is the revenue generation method? 3) How does the product/service flow between parties? 4) What specific slides or content supports this classification?"
        }
    )

```

## Step 3: Load the Document
We will use `Retab` to load the pitch deck document.

```python
from retab import Retab

reclient = Retab()
doc_msg = reclient.documents.create_messages(
    document="airbnb_pitch_deck.pdf"
)
```

## Step 4: Schema Creation
We create a schema object using the `Schema` class from Retab to structure the extraction process.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py
from retab import Schema

schema_obj = Schema(
    pydantic_model=Deck
)
```
```python json_schema.json

## Step 5: Perform LLM Analysis
We use OpenAI's GPT model to analyze the document and extract structured data.

The reasoning fields (see `result_with_reasoning.json`) helps the model to reason about the data and extract it in the correct format.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py (OpenAI Completions API)
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-5-nano",
    messages=schema_obj.openai_messages + doc_msg.openai_messages,
    response_format=schema_obj.inference_pydantic_model
)

assert completion.choices[0].message.parsed is not None
print(json.dumps(completion.choices[0].message.parsed.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

```python main.py (OpenAI Responses API)
from openai import OpenAI
import json

client = OpenAI()
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5-nano",
    input = schema_obj.openai_responses_input + doc_msg.openai_responses_input,
    text ={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "json_schema": schema_obj.inference_json_schema
        }
    }
)

assert response.output_text is not None
print(response.output_text)
```

```json result_with_reasoning.json

  "investors": {
    "name": "Angel Investors",
    "type": "investor",
    "relationship": "investor"
  },
  "reasoning___competitors": "1) The competitive landscape is represented in the Competition slide which lists CouchSurfing, Craigslist, BedandBreakfast.com, Hostels.com, Rentabi.com, Orbitz, and others. 2) Features such as rental transactions and budget accommodation indicate they overlap with AirBed&Breakfast's offering.",

      "firstName": "Joe",
      "lastName": "Gebbia",

}
```
</CodeGroup>
## Step 6: Validate Extracted Data
Finally, validate the extracted data against the schema by removing reasoning fields.

<CodeGroup>
```python main.py (OpenAI Completions API)
from main_server.libs.document_analysis.functions.json_schema  import filter_auxiliary_fields_json

assert completion.choices[0].message.content is not None
extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(completion.choices[0].message.content)
)

print(json.dumps(extraction.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

```python main.py (OpenAI Responses API)
from main_server.libs.document_analysis.functions.json_schema  import filter_auxiliary_fields_json

assert response.output_text is not None
extraction = schema_obj.pydantic_model.model_validate(
    filter_auxiliary_fields_json(response.output_text)
)

print(json.dumps(extraction.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

```json final_result.json

Your task is to extract structured information from pitch decks based on the provided schema. Carefully analyze the content to identify relevant details and populate each field accurately while maintaining consistency across extracted data.

Key Guidelines:
	1.	Understanding the Schema:
	•	The schema includes key entities such as the company, its investors, competitors, clients, team members, and business model. Each field must be carefully reviewed and filled with precise data extracted from the deck.
	•	Relationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.
	2.	Contextual Analysis:
	•	Consider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.
	•	Extract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).
	3.	Consistency and Accuracy:
	•	Ensure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.
	•	Avoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.
	4.	Data Formatting:
	•	Company Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.
	•	Website: Extract and format URLs correctly 
	•	Country: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.
	•	Business Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.
	5.	Handling Team Data:
	•	Identify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.
	•	Prioritize executives and founding members when available.
	6.	Dealing with Missing Information:
	•	If some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.
	•	Ensure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.

Extraction Output:
	•	The extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.
	•	The output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.

By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.

Your task is to extract structured information from pitch decks based on the provided schema. Carefully analyze the content to identify relevant details and populate each field accurately while maintaining consistency across extracted data.

Key Guidelines:
	1.	Understanding the Schema:
	•	The schema includes key entities such as the company, its investors, competitors, clients, team members, and business model. Each field must be carefully reviewed and filled with precise data extracted from the deck.
	•	Relationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.
	2.	Contextual Analysis:
	•	Consider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.
	•	Extract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).
	3.	Consistency and Accuracy:
	•	Ensure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.
	•	Avoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.
	4.	Data Formatting:
	•	Company Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.
	•	Website: Extract and format URLs correctly 
	•	Country: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.
	•	Business Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.
	5.	Handling Team Data:
	•	Identify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.
	•	Prioritize executives and founding members when available.
	6.	Dealing with Missing Information:
	•	If some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.
	•	Ensure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.

Extraction Output:
	•	The extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.
	•	The output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.

By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.
