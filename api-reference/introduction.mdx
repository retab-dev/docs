## Welcome to our API

Our API provides a set of endpoints that allow you to programmatically interact with our services. 
This documentation will help you understand how to use our API effectively.


## Installation

To install the API client, you can use the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash python
pip install retab
```

```bash Javascript
npm i @retab/node
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using our API keys. If you don't have an API key, please create one on our [dashboard](https://www.retab.com/dashboard).
