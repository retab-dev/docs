## What are Retab Widgets?

Retab Widgets (`@retab/react`) is a React component library that provides drop-in UI components for document extraction workflows. Instead of building extraction interfaces from scratch, you can use pre-built, customizable components that handle:

- **Document viewing** - PDF rendering, image zoom, field highlighting
- **Data display** - Form, table, and code views for extracted data
- **Human-in-the-loop review** - Complete interfaces for reviewing and editing extractions
- **File uploads** - Drag-and-drop uploading with progress tracking

These components are designed to work seamlessly with the Retab API and can be integrated into any React application.

## Installation

Install the package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @retab/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @retab/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @retab/react
```

```bash bun
bun add @retab/react
```
</CodeGroup>

Import the required styles in your application's root layout or entry point:

```tsx layout.tsx
import "@retab/react/styles.css";
```

## Architecture

The widget library uses a provider pattern. Wrap your application (or the portion that needs Retab functionality) with `RetabProvider`:

```tsx providers.tsx
import { RetabProvider } from "@retab/react";
import "@retab/react/styles.css";

export default function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <RetabProvider
      projectId="proj_xxx"
      authConfig={{
        getToken: async () => {
          // Fetch a session token from your backend
          const response = await fetch("/api/retab/token");
          const { token } = await response.json();
          return token;
        },
        baseUrl: "https://api.retab.com",
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </RetabProvider>
  );
}
```

The provider handles:

- **Authentication** - Token management and API requests
- **Project context** - Loading project configuration and JSON schema
- **Extractions state** - Managing extraction lists and selection
- **OCR context** - Field location detection for source highlighting
